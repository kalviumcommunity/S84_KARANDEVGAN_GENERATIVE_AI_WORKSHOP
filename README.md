# 🧠 HealthMate – Your AI Symptom Checker Bot  
*"Bringing clarity to your symptoms, one smart chat at a time."*

---

## 🩺 Overview

**HealthMate** is an AI-powered conversational assistant that helps users **check symptoms**, **understand possible causes**, and receive **next-step recommendations** in a reliable, conversational way.

Whether it's a headache, stomach cramp, or fatigue, HealthMate listens to your symptoms and provides:

- 🧠 **Likely conditions** based on medical symptom mappings  
- 🧾 **Follow-up suggestions**: whether to hydrate, rest, or see a doctor  
- 💬 A natural, human-like **chat interface** powered by LLMs  

> 🤝 HealthMate is designed for early symptom guidance — not for replacing doctors, but for helping you understand *when* to see one.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 🧑‍⚕️ User Experience
You enter symptoms in plain English like:

```

"I’ve had a sore throat and mild fever for two days."

````

### 🧠 AI Pipeline

1. **NLP Processing**  
   Parses symptoms using OpenAI GPT API or spaCy to extract structured health data.

2. **Condition Mapping**  
   Matches symptoms to probable conditions using a medical database (e.g., SymCAT or open-source mappings).

3. **Response Generation**  
   Returns:
   - 📋 Top 2-3 possible conditions
   - 💡 Advice on next steps (rest, see GP, home remedy)
   - 🚑 Risk alert (if symptoms are critical)

4. *(Optional)* — Add a touch of empathy or light humor to make interactions less clinical.
